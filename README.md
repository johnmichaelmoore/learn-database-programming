# learn-database-programming
following the HeyTuts youtube tutorial on RPI 
I am doing this tutorial to try and learn enough to help out with the RARA member database.
The link to the HeyTuts tutorial is https://heytuts.com/web-dev/php/create-a-member-system-in-php
It follows a seried on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk-EmIiBIYGHVyFon7ld2yCdGwIJk2eDU
I have set up a raspberry pi as a target on which to run the tutorial programs.
